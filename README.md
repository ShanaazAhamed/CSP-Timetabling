# CSP: Timetabling

## Control Satisfaction Problem

There is a list of subjects, a set of possible
time slots for each subject and a set of rooms. Some subjects are compulsory while some are optional. Following are the constraints to satisfy.

### Input.csv file
```
SUB_1,o,Tu1,Tu2,F3,
SUB_2,o,M2,M3,Tu2,
.
.
.
SUB_13,c,W1,Th3,F1,
R1,R2,R3
```
`c` - Compulsory

`o` - Optional

### Constrains
- A given subjects can be assigned only to one of the possible time slots given for that 
subject
- A given subjects can be assigned only to one of the possible time slots given for that 
subject
- Two subjects cannot be assigned to the same room if they are assigned to the same time 
slot

`Backtracking` is a general 
algorithmic strategy for solving computing problems that takes into consideration looking 
through all possible combinations.

### To run virtual environment on VSCode


```
# macOS/Linux
# You may need to run sudo apt-get install python3-venv first
python3 -m venv .venv

# Windows
# You can also use py -3 -m venv .venv
python -m venv .venv
```

### On VSCode

```
1. `ctrl` + `shift` + `p` and select Python Interpreter
2. Select the `enter interpreter path`
3. Browse and select `.venv/Scripts/python.exe`
```
If you want to manually specify a default interpreter that will be used once you first open your workspace, you can create or modify an entry for `python.defaultInterpreterPath` setting in your workspace settings.json with the full path to the Python executable. 

In `settings.json`

```
{
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "YOUR_PATH/.venv/Scripts/python.exe"
}

```


## Input Command

```
python main.py Input.csv Output.csv
```

### Output.csv file

```
SUB_1, Tu1, R1
SUB_2, M2, R1
.
.
SUB_13, F1, R1
```
